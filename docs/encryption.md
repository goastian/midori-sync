# Midori Sync — Encryption

This document describes the retired extension-era format and proposed legacy rotation
flow. Its source remains available at commit `33690ac8b621980ded566bea370fa1efb37b5300`.
Native V2 uses a versioned JSON envelope and the separate registry defined
in [native-sync-api.md](native-sync-api.md). Migration must use the verified
compatibility fixtures rather than infer guarantees from the older rotation
description. Encryption of Sync records does not make Link's ordinary searchable
library end-to-end encrypted.

## Overview

Midori Sync uses **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**. The server never has access to plaintext Sync records. The legacy format described here was encrypted by the retired extension; native Desktop uses its Rust crypto component.

## Algorithms

| Purpose | Algorithm | Library |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Symmetric Encryption | XChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD) | libsodium |
| Key Derivation (password) | Argon2id | libsodium |
| Key Derivation (sub-keys) | BLAKE2B (crypto_kdf) | libsodium |
| URL hashing (record IDs) | BLAKE2b-128 (`crypto_generichash`) | libsodium |

## Key Hierarchy

```
User Passphrase (BIP39 mnemonic, 12 words)
       │
       ▼ Argon2id (ops=3, mem=64 MB, ALG_ARGON2ID13)
  Master Key (32 bytes)
       │
       ▼ crypto_kdf_derive_from_key, context = "MSPv1key"
       │
       ├── Index 0 → Wrapping Key (server-side key bundle)
       ├── Index 1 → Bookmarks
       ├── Index 2 → History
       ├── Index 3 → Tabs                 (alias: open-tabs, legacy)
       ├── Index 4 → Browser Settings
       ├── Index 5 → Midori Tab
       ├── Index 6 → Midori Privacy
       ├── Index 7 → Devices
       └── Index 8 → Passwords
```

The 8-byte KDF context `MSPv1key` separates collection sub-keys from
unrelated key derivations (see "Local lock", below).

### Stable index contract

KDF indices are part of the on-the-wire contract. They MUST never be
reordered or repurposed: doing so silently re-derives a sub-key for the
wrong collection, producing data that decrypts cleanly but is typed
incorrectly. New collections claim a fresh index. Legacy aliases
(`open-tabs` → 3) reuse an existing index on purpose so that
already-uploaded ciphertexts remain decryptable.

The legacy collection indices are retained here for migration. New native collection identifiers are governed by the versioned native contract and its fixtures.

## Payload Layout

The wire format for every encrypted record is base64 of a single
contiguous byte string:

```
+-----------------------+----------------------------------+--------------+
| nonce (24 bytes)      | ciphertext (= |plaintext| bytes) | tag (16 B)   |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------+--------------+
```

The base64 alphabet is libsodium's `ORIGINAL` variant (RFC 4648 with
`+`/`/` and `=` padding).

### Invariants

- `len(nonce) == crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_NPUBBYTES == 24`.
- `len(tag) == crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_ABYTES == 16`.
- `len(combined) == 24 + len(plaintext) + 16`.
- The nonce is generated with `randombytes_buf` per encryption call.
  XChaCha20's 192-bit nonce makes random selection collision-safe at any
  realistic scale.
- Encryption is randomized in the (key, plaintext) pair, so two
  consecutive encryptions of the same plaintext yield distinct
  ciphertexts.
- Authentication is computed over `(ciphertext, ad=nil)`. Flipping any
  byte of the combined payload (nonce, ciphertext, or tag) MUST cause
  decryption to fail with an error rather than return manipulated
  plaintext.

These are the legacy format invariants that native migration must preserve.
The retired extension test was removed with the extension runtime; native
compatibility fixtures and tests must cover these properties before migration.

## Encryption Flow

### Encrypting a Record

1. Serialize data to a JSON string.
2. Get the collection sub-key from the master key (see hierarchy).
3. Generate a random 24-byte nonce.
4. Encrypt with `crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt`.
5. Concatenate: `nonce (24) || ciphertext || tag (16)`.
6. Base64-encode the concatenated bytes.
7. Send the base64 string as the `payload` field to the API.

### Decrypting a Record

1. Base64-decode the `payload` field.
2. Split: first 24 bytes = nonce, the remaining bytes = ciphertext+tag.
3. Get the collection sub-key.
4. Decrypt with `crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt`.
5. Parse the JSON string.

## Server-side Key Bundle

The master key itself is encrypted and stored on the server so that new
devices can retrieve it after authentication:

1. Derive a **wrapping key** (sub-key index 0) from the same passphrase.
2. Encrypt the master key's base64 representation with the wrapping key.
3. Store as JSON: `{ v: 1, salt: "<base64>", bundle: "<encrypted>" }`.

To set up a new device the user enters their passphrase:

1. Download the encrypted key bundle from the server.
2. Parse JSON, extract `salt`.
3. Re-derive the wrapping key from passphrase + salt.
4. Decrypt to recover the master key.

## Argon2id execution

Argon2id is memory-hard (64 MB) and CPU-bound (`opslimit=3`). To keep
the background page / service worker responsive, it is executed inside
a dedicated Web Worker in the retired extension. The worker
loads its own copy of libsodium so the rest of the extension does not
need to import the sumo build until it actually performs other crypto
(lazy-loading objective).

`MidoriSyncCrypto.deriveKeys()` automatically delegates to the worker
when running inside the extension. In environments without `Worker`
support (Node tests, sandboxes) it falls back to a synchronous
`crypto_pwhash` call. If the worker errors out at runtime, the next
`deriveKeys()` call also degrades to the synchronous path so a broken
worker never blocks login.

## Local Lock (optional)

Without configuration the seed phrase and the encryption key live in
plaintext inside `browser.storage.local`. Users who want at-rest
protection can opt in to a **local passphrase**:

- The seed phrase + encryption key are wrapped under a key derived from
  the local passphrase (Argon2id, KDF context `MSPv1lck` to keep this
  derivation distinct from collection sub-keys).
- After the passphrase is set, plaintext copies are removed from
  `browser.storage.local`. Only the encrypted bundle remains at rest.
- An **inactivity alarm** (default 15 minutes, configurable per user)
  wipes the in-memory key. The next user action requires `unlockEncryption`.
- The plaintext seed phrase, while unlocked, is held only in memory.
  Locking wipes it; viewing it again requires re-unlocking.

Lock-related IPC messages exposed by the background page:

| Message | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `getLockStatus` | `{ hasPassphrase, locked, timeoutMinutes }` |
| `enableLocalPassphrase` | Set or rotate the local passphrase |
| `disableLocalPassphrase` | Remove the passphrase, restore plaintext storage |
| `lockEncryption` | Manual lock now |
| `unlockEncryption` | Decrypt the bundle and rehydrate the key |

When no local passphrase is set, the existing behavior is preserved
verbatim: plaintext seed in `storage.local`, no inactivity timeout.

## Master Key Rotation

Rotation is needed when the user wants to invalidate a leaked
passphrase, change KDF parameters, or recover from suspected device
compromise. The procedure is **incremental** so a rotation can survive
a power loss between collections.

### Trigger

Initiated from the extension Settings UI ("Rotate master key"). The
caller supplies the *current* passphrase and a new passphrase.

### Procedure

1. **Verify** the current passphrase by decrypting the server-side key
   bundle. Refuse to continue on failure.
2. **Generate** a fresh 16-byte salt and derive a new master key
   `M_new = Argon2id(new_passphrase, salt_new)`.
3. **Encrypt** `M_new` under a wrapping key derived from `new_passphrase
   + salt_new` and upload the new bundle to the server with version
   `v+1`. The legacy `/crypto/keys` endpoint stores only the latest bundle;
   it does not retain the previous bundle for other devices. The native key
   registry preserves previous bundles separately, but the resumable native
   reciphering and retirement workflow is still under implementation.
4. For each collection `C`, in order:
    1. Page records server-side using the existing `delta` cursor and
       `version` filter.
    2. For every page, decrypt with `M_old`'s sub-key for `C`, re-encrypt
       with `M_new`'s sub-key for `C`, and upload via the existing
       `batchUpsert` UPSERT. The server-side `version` column advances
       naturally and conditional GETs on other devices invalidate.
    3. Persist a per-collection rotation cursor in `browser.storage.local`
       (`{ rotationCursor: { [collection]: lastRotatedDelta } }`).
       Resuming after interruption picks up at the cursor.
5. Once **all** collections report a cursor at or beyond the latest
   `delta` observed in step 1, mark rotation complete: delete the
   previous bundle on the server, drop the rotation cursor, and overwrite
   `M_old` in memory with zeros.
6. Other devices observe the bundle version bump and prompt for the new
   passphrase on their next sync.

### Invariants during rotation

- `M_old` and `M_new` coexist in memory only (never both on disk) until
  step 5.
- A record is never deleted as part of rotation; it is only re-encrypted.
  A failed rotation leaves the system in a consistent but mixed state
  (some collections under `M_new`, others under `M_old`), which the next
  resume cycle finishes.
- Reads during rotation are best-effort: if decrypt with `M_new` fails,
  fall back to `M_old` for one cycle, then give up. This bounds the
  blast radius of a corrupt bundle.

### Out of scope (intentionally)

- Forward secrecy across rotations: rotation does not re-key the
  server-side `version` chain, so an attacker who recorded ciphertexts
  before rotation can still decrypt them with `M_old`.
- Atomic global rotation: by construction the procedure is per-collection
  and idempotent so it can resume after browser restarts.

## Security Properties

- **Zero-knowledge server**: server stores only encrypted blobs.
- **Forward secrecy across records**: each record uses a random nonce.
- **Authenticated encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher;
  any tampering causes decryption to fail.
- **Memory-hard KDF**: Argon2id with 64 MB raises the cost of brute-force
  on weak passphrases.
- **Per-collection isolation**: compromising one sub-key does not expose
  other collections.
- **Off-main-thread KDF**: Argon2id runs in a dedicated worker so the
  background page stays responsive during login and rotation.

## Client Library

The retired extension used libsodium for this format. Native Desktop uses its Rust crypto component; the server and web dashboard no longer carry the extension's JavaScript crypto bundle.

## Nonce Size

XChaCha20 uses a 192-bit (24-byte) nonce. This is large enough that
random nonce generation is safe without risk of collision, even over
billions of encryptions.
